# web-hammer

A chrome extension to help users remove banners(or other unwanted elements) from a web page.

This tool will be useful to people who read lots of blog articles, since most blog articles often have
immutable header/footer/banner (and these often get in the way of reading the content)

Here's a little demo :)
